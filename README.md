# 🛒 Amharic E-commerce Data Extractor for EthioMart

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project develops a **smart FinTech engine** that transforms unstructured Telegram messages into structured business data — helping EthioMart identify the most promising vendors for micro-lending.

I build a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system to extract:
- 📦 Product Names
- 💰 Prices
- 📍 Locations  and so on ...
from **Amharic text, images, and documents** shared across multiple Telegram channels.
